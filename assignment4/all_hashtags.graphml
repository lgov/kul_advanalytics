The media is doing a poor job informing the public with accurate information on COVID-19. They bring on self-proclaimed experts that make claims that have no ground in science and sometimes are full-on lying. Also, I think they are leaning into the fear angle too hard in order to draw clicks and viewership. I believe they should uphold proper journalistic standards and stick to the facts!

Before proceeding, please note that this general overview is compiled for initial self-assessment only and may vary for each individual. If you're not feeling well, you should immediately consult a medical practitioner to have an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of COVID-19.
The typical daily symptoms are concluded from the study of 138 patients at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and another study involving 135 patients from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital.
These symptoms are broken down into:
DAY 1 TO DAY 2
The beginning symptoms are similar to the common cold with a mild sore throat and neither having a fever nor feeling tired. Patients can still consume food and drink as usual.
DAY 3
The patient's throats start to feel a bit painful. Body temperature reads at around 36.5° celsius. Although it's uncommon, other symptoms like mild nausea, vomiting or mild diarrhea are possible to set in. 
DAY 4
Throat pain becomes more serious. Other symptoms like feeling weak and joint pain start to manifest. The patient may show a temperature reading between 36.5° to 37° celsius.
DAY 5 TO 6
Mild fever starts. The patients show a temperature reading above 37.2° celsius. The second most common symptom, dry cough, also appears. Dyspnea or breathing difficulty may occur occasionally. Most patients in this stage are easily feeling tired. Other symptoms remain about the same. These four symptoms are among the top five key indications of COVID-19 according to the final report of the initial outbreak conducted by the joint mission of China and WHO.
DAY 7
The patients that haven't started recovering by day 7 get more serious coughs and breathing difficulty. Fever can get higher up to 38° celsius. Patients may develop further headache and body pain or worsening diarrhea if there’s any. Many patients are admitted to the hospital at this stage. 
DAY 8 TO 9 
On the 8th day, the symptoms are likely to be worsened for the patient who has coexisting medical conditions. Severe shortness of breath becomes more frequent. Temperature reading goes well above 38°. In one of the studies, day 9 is the average time when Sepsis starts to affect 40% of the patients.
DAY 10 TO 11
Doctors are ordering imaging tests like chest x-ray to capture the severity of respiratory distress in patients. Patients are having loss of appetite and may be facing abdominal pain. The condition also needs immediate treatment in ICU. 
DAY 12 TO 14
For the survivors, the symptoms can be well-managed at this point. Fever tends to get better and breathing difficulties may start to cease on day 13. But Some patients may still be affected by mild cough even after hospital discharge.  
DAY 15 TO 16
Day 15 is the opposite condition for the rest of the minority patients . The fragile group must prepare for the possibility of acute cardiac injury or kidney injury. 
DAY 17 TO 19
COVID-19 fatality cases happen at around day 18. Before the time, vulnerable patients may develop a secondary infection caused by a new pathogen in the lower respiratory tract. The severe condition may then lead to a blood coagulation and ischemia.
DAY 20 TO 22
The surviving patients are recovered completely from the disease and are discharged from the hospital.

Cases range from mild to critical. The average timeline from the first symptom to recovery is about 17 days, but some cases are fatal. Here's what it looks like to develop COVID-19, day by day.

WELCOME TO MEDICAL MEME REVIEW EP 7!!!!

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

WELCOME TO MEDICAL MEME REVIEW EP 8!!! 

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

As you may have noticed, we like to blow stuff up on this channel. So when the International Red Cross approached us to collaborate on a video about nuclear weapons, we were more than excited.
Until we did the research. It turned out we were a bit oblivious off the real impact of nuclear weapons in the real world, on a real city. And especially, how helpless even the most developed nations on earth would be if an attack occurred today.
So hopefully this video demonstrates how extremely non fun a real world nuclear attack would be, without being too gruesome. This collaboration was a blast (no pun intended) and we want to say a huge thank you to the International Red Cross!

Produced in Association with Real Stories.

It’s a mystery that spans decades, continents and cultures, and bridges one Toronto woman’s life with her childhood in Japan: what happened to Fukue?

In 1988, Jessica Stuart was nine years old. Her family embarked on a cultural odyssey that would greatly influence her life: the Stuarts dug up their middle-class roots in Vancouver’s Jewish community and replanted them in a rural Japanese town called Saku for a year.

It was during this absorbing year that Jessica met Fukue, a bright and bubbly girl with rosy red cheeks and an endless smile. Fukue and Jessica became like sisters, spending their days frolicking in the autumn leaves, dancing under snow-blanketed trees, watching hot air balloons illuminate the skyline in spring and sneaking through rice paddies in early summer.

Strangely, Fukue never invited Jessica to visit her family home. One day after school, Jessica insisted. Fukue reluctantly brought Jessica to her house; it was a derelict shack on the outskirts of town. Shocked and disturbed, Jessica started to make sense of the name-calling and bullying that Fukue suffered at school.

As the Stuarts’ year in Japan came to an end, Jessica and Fukue assured one another they would keep in touch. They became pen pals, writing letters back and forth for two years, until the letters from Fukue stopped — with no explanation.

Now a musician in her 30s, Jessica has never forgotten Fukue. Her memories of their time together are beautiful, but haunting. And so her thoughts turn to the unknown. Where is Fukue now? Does she remember Jessica? Why did her letters stop all those years ago?

Now, nearly 30 years after she left Japan, Jessica is going back to find the answers to these questions. She’s going to find Fukue.

Thomas @thom.as.allan   Shayla @shaylaallan Kyle @kyleledotnet
Shayla and her twin brother, Thomas, were adopted at 6 months old by a family from Calgary who relocated to Trinidad for work. Meanwhile,  two older sisters were adopted previously and still live in the Toronto area. Due to unfortunate circumstances, difficult situations, and past struggles with the law, Shayla’s birth parents lost custody shortly after they were born. Shayla always knew her birth parents’ full names and used Facebook to find her birth mother and followed her throughout the years.  Just a few months ago, Shayla’s adoptive mom noticed a girl on her birth mother’s page that resembled Shayla a lot. Eventually, when Shayla was able to reach her older sister Seleena, she was also able to reach her oldest sister, Samantha. And with these connections, finally Shayla found her father, a former Vietnamese boat refugee who immigrated to Canada by himself.

The grandmother has been running around for many years and finally set up a Shanghai Hukou for Zhu Junlong, but Zhu Junlong is still late for school, and his English is not that good. After the black teacher Birdy knew it, he volunteered to teach Zhu Junlong English and regarded him as his family. Now Zhu Junlong is 18 years old. He just finished the spring exam and he became an otaku. Grandma is also starting nagging, and she doesn't quite understand Zhu Junlong, the world of the boy after 2000. Although Zhu Junlong will be impatient, he will always let her grandmother nag at him. He currently wants to be independent as soon as possible, and he has also found a part-time job near his home. Birdy is worried about whether his future is going well, but Zhu Junlong is humorous and he has lots of friends. He is very confident about the future.

Bodysuits don’t have to look very realistic if they are covered by clothes, but if the actor’s stomach or chest is exposed, then they will have to trick the viewers. For “Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music,” legendary special makeup effects artist Kevin Yagher of Kevin Yagher Productions Inc. created muscle and fat suits for actors Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter. To make the muscle suits look real, Yagher and his team sculpted subtle veins and used an airbrush to paint on skin details like pores. They used silicone for the skin, as the material is translucent the same way human skin is, and foam latex underneath to help it move like a real body. Meanwhile, a realistic fat suit needs some jiggle to it. After working on the Nicolas Cage movie “Adaptation,” Yagher learned that stuffing a fake paunch with beads is the best way to make it bounce.

Thank you to Kevin Yagher for speaking with us and providing us footage and photos! Check out more of his work here:

Alot of People asked me to make Katana so i tried my best to make a perfect Katana Sword as i can. 

Overall Sword Length : 35 Inches
Handle Length : 8 Inches
Blade Length : 26 Inches

All the Processes are below of making this beautiful KATANA:
Forging:
          It took me almost three days to hand forge an Iron Chain piece into a long Metal Strip and this was one of my hardest forging ever. I don't have a power hammer so i did all the forging with hands and turned a chain piece into an almost 33 - 34 inches long steel strip.   
Grinding:
          I started some rough grindings of long strip on my Belt sander and turned the strip into a Katana shaped long steel piece. I also hand sanded the edges with the help of file to remove almost all the roughness of the sword.
          o. I made the Blood Groove with the help of rotary grinder.
          o. The blade bevel was made by my professional angle grinder.
          o. Hand Sanded the blade to remove roughness.
Hardness:
          There is a professional way to harden a Katana and that is
                   Covering the whole sword in a Fire Clay (Insulation) Except the blade bevel.After that we put the sword into the fire and heat it to critical temperature. We use oil to Quench the heated sword in it. Now the Bevel is hard and the remaining sword is annealed. Tempering the blade is the best way to increase the Strength, Hardness and Toughness of the sword.
Hibaki:
           This piece is traditionally made by forging some copper or brass but we can also make it by casting these metals. And the purpose of hibaki is to hold the Sheath with the handle.
Handle:
           The Handle contains three parts.
            o.    GUARD: I made the guard by using a thick brass sheet, which is roundly turned into a beautiful metal piece that can show a partition between the handle and the remaining sword.
            o.     Spacer: This is the little metal piece which fits on tang and controls the fittings of the whole handle so nothing should vibrate in handle.
            o.     Wood: A nice piece of wood uses as a handle of the sword and that could be Wrapped by some soft (leather) strips.

Emirates receives approximately 144,000 applicants a year. The video incorrectly states that only veteran and first class attendants get to staff events. Any level Cabin Crew can staff events, not just limited to first class or veteran crew. Insider regrets the errors.

Emirates Airline has over 20,000 flight attendants in their cabin crew. We spoke with Siti Nurazlin to see what it's like to be a first-class flight attendant for the luxury airline.

Viele Themen im Leben bekommen erst dann den Stellenwert, den sie verdient haben, wenn man als Mensch die Gelegenheit bekommt sich in ein Leben hineinzuversetzen, das nicht zwangsläufig das eigene ist.

Das funktioniert aber auch nur, wenn jemand bereit ist, seine Welt zu öffnen und mit Geduld und Beharrlichkeit vielleicht auch schon zum wiederholten Mal zu sagen, was es braucht, damit sich was zum Guten ändert. Das ist #NichtSelbstverständlich.

#JKvsP7 #ProSieben

Joko und Klaas sind die Könige der Unterhaltung. Ihre Shows und Filme haben alle Zutaten für gutes Entertainment: Action, Humor und eine Prise Ironie.

Was ist fake und was ist real bei Joko und Klaas' Einspielfilmen? Gunnar, Han und Super-Praktikant Emil finden in YouTube-Kommentaren Spuren von Fake. Dann beginnt ihre Spurensuche bei Joko und Klaas und ihrer Produktionsfirma Florida TV.

Summary:  The internet challenged Mr. Beast to plant 20 million trees.  That is a really hard thing to do. So we banded together all our YouTube friends and started #teamtrees.  Basically we partnered with Arbor Day and got them to agree that for every $1 we raise, they would plant 1 tree.

Point of clarification:  A few people have pointed out the dates on the negative and positive Covid tests are the same.  You'll also notice my doctor was Bob Newby from Stranger Things.  Turns out there is a lot of personal info on a Covid result test and the part that says negative and positive wasn't easily readable so I photoshopped up something that solved both of those issues and didn't bother changing the date.  No conspiracy here.  I promise I actually got Covid and would have much preferred to actually filmed on the original schedule and not had to deal with it even with the private jet silver lining.

Mais de 750 mil pessoas morrem anualmente no mundo por causa de picadas de mosquitos, o que transforma este animalzinho em 180 vezes mais letal do que leões, crocodilos e tubarões juntos

CHIKUNGUNYAA 

Febre Chikungunya é uma doença transmitida pelos mosquitos Aedes aegypti e Aedes albopictus. No Brasil, a circulação do vírus foi identificada pela primeira vez em 2014. Chikungunya significa "aqueles que se dobram" em swahili, um dos idiomas da Tanzânia. Refere-se à aparência curvada dos pacientes que foram atendidos na primeira epidemia documentada, na Tanzânia, localizada no leste da África, entre 1952 e 1953. O Zika é um vírus transmitido pelo Aedes aegypti e identificado pela primeira vez no Brasil em abril de 2015. O vírus Zika recebeu a mesma denominação do local de origem de sua identificação em 1947, após detecção em macacos sentinelas para monitoramento da febre amarela, na floresta Zika, em Uganda.

 A dengue é uma doença viral transmitida pelo mosquito Aedes aegypti. No Brasil, foi identificada pela primeira vez em 1986. Estima-se que 50 milhões de infecções por dengue ocorram anualmente no mundo.  #VitorVietri</data><data key="dislikes">4300</data><data key="is_premiered">false</data><data key="id">PVQKjsmx__I</data><data key="href">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVQKjsmx__I</data><data key="is_private">false</data></node>

Wow is such a unique idea, you just take advantage of the foam food containers, cut the round holes and put water in it. After 5 days you have the onions and garlic plants growing, this way you do not have to water them daily
Please make it yourself at home. good luck!

Há alguns anos, construímos um trebuchet de palitos de bambu. Esse tipo de catapulta usa um contrapeso no lugar dos elásticos e é muito mais eficiente. Desta vez, resolvemos radicalizar e construir um trebuchet de vários metros de comprimento, usando um contrapeso de centenas de quilos, capaz de arremessar projéteis a centenas de metros de distância.

Esta é uma experiência de Física muito interessante em que é possível explorar balística, alavancas, gravidade, conservação da quantidade de movimento, transferência de energia e muito mais!
