The UK's leading health experts have issued new guidance following evidence that in extremely rare cases people who've had the vaccine have developed blood clots. 

The UK  regulator, the MHRA, said the guidance was not proof the vaccine had caused the clots but it said the link was getting firmer.

So from now on people in the UK aged between 18 and 29 will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.

The regulator has insisted that the benefits of taking the AstraZeneca vaccine -- still far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.

A senior official in the agency said in an interview published on Tuesday that there seemed to be a connection, although it was unclear how this happened.
"In my opinion, we can say it now, it is clear there is a link with the vaccine. But we still do not know what causes this reaction," EMA head of vaccines Marco Cavaleri told Italy's Il Messaggero newspaper. "In the next few hours, we will say that there is a connection, but we still have to understand how this happens," Cavaleri said. "It is now increasingly difficult to say that there is no cause-and-effect relationship between vaccination with AstraZeneca and very rare cases of unusual blood clots associated with low platelet counts," he added. The EMA was already expected to provide an updated assessment this week. Questions about serious blood clots in a tiny minority of cases have undermined confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Several EU countries including France, Italy, and Germany — the bloc's three largest countries by population — either suspended or limited the use of the vaccine before the EMA declared that the benefits outweighed the risks and it should remain in use.

During this lecture we will be discussing COVID-19 vaccines including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca/Oxford. 

We are NOT sponsored and/or endorsed by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Astrazeneca. We are presenting on RESEARCH and in no way is any of the information provided our own view or opinions. 

This will be a lecture packed with the process vaccine developers must go through; which includes a preclinical phase and phases I-III. Including information about OPERATION WARP SPEED and how this has expedited the normally lengthy vaccine process. 

We will then discuss how Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca vaccines work in the human body, preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hopefully, ending this global pandemic. 

Finally-- Zach presents on all of the most current data that each of the vaccine companies have released outlining the vaccine procedure and how it will be administered, the vaccine efficacy (as a percentage), optimal storage temperature of the vaccine in order to remain viable, and the number of vaccine units these companies are capable of producing. 

IMPORTANT INFO (MUST READ):
One thing to emphasize that wasn’t harped on enough from this lecture is when these vaccines lead to an immunogenic reaction as we described above, which leads to formation of Memory B cells and Memory T cells. This is important because if we are exposed to the virus those memory cells are now primed and able to recognize and mount a powerful immune response against the virus. 

LASTLY, one additional point and clarification is when those cytotoxic T cells produce destructive molecules that damage host cells it’s important to realize that those are memory cytotoxic T cells primed by the Vaccine that damage host cells that ARE INFECTED with the SARS-COV-2 virus, NOT CELLS processing the vaccine. 

Big Takeaway:
1. Vaccine stimulates antibody production to protect against virus IF INFECTED.
2. Vaccine stimulates development of memory T and B cells to protect against virus IF INFECTED.

An obstetrician/gynecologist (Dr. Gregory Michael) in Miami, Florida, received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Dec.18th. Shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia. He died 16 days after getting the covid vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael's cause of death is a result of a brain hemorrhage. Obviously, this is horrible. It’s tragic, and you feel for his family. 

But it makes you wonder, was his death a result of the covid 19 vaccines? 
And if it resulted from the covid 19 vaccine, should that change your perspective on the covid 19 vaccines? 
So I’m going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first, let's learn a little more about what happened. 
Pfizer is actively investigating the case.

Over 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine or Moderna Covid 19 Vaccine, the two authorized in the United States. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis, meaning a severe allergic reaction. None of which were reported as fatal. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache, or fever, which typically last a day or so.

The Miami-Dade County medical examiner’s office is investigating Dr. Gregory Michael's death, and as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based on the reports, let's see what we can make of his case.

Dr. Gregory Michael was healthy. He did not smoke. Did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication nor vaccines. Supposedly three days after he gets the 1st dose of the covid 19 vaccines, he developed tiny reddish spots, or petechiae, caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet.

This prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done, and his platelet levels are low, which is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelet counts range from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than ten thousand. His levels were reportedly zero, and because they're so low or absent, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit for two weeks. Doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Presumably, they tried several different treatments. Typically we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also, we give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salmeterol or methylprednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramaplastum or eltrombopag to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. Sometimes we give immunoglobulins, sometimes we give a drug called rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. Still, shortly before that, he ends up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. 

A sudden get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Now there are some cases like this reported with certain drugs medications can lead to thrombocytopenia. As a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system, they attack the body's platelets. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and it should be suspected when someone has sudden severe thrombocytopenia.

South Korea's mass immunization campaign is picking up pace amid safety concerns.
While no direct link is found, three more post-vaccination deaths reported, all of them AstraZeneca's.
Authorities are following up with meticulous investigations.
In Germany, there's a changing stance on the AstraZeneca vaccine, allowing over-65s to receive the jab, claiming recent studies provided enough data.
Kim Dami has our top story.
Three more AstraZeneca vaccine recipients died on Thursday, two were in their 50s and one was in their 20s.
Both of those in their 50s were patients at nursing hospitals in Jeollabuk-do Province and had underlying conditions.... cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
While the first patient died two days after getting the shot, the second person died just one day after.
The person in their 20s, who suffered from epilepsy, died at a nursing hospital in the city of Daejeon... two days after being given the vaccine.
This brings the country's total vaccine deaths to five.
While health authorities believe there is no causal effect, the country's Prime Minister has vowed for a full investigation.
"The government will thoroughly investigate the deaths and openly share the results. So please believe in the government and get your vaccine shots."
515 new cases of AstraZeneca vaccine side effects were filed on Thursday, raising the total to 722.
But the country's nationwide vaccination program continues... with patients and medical staff at hosptials designated by the health ministry to treat people in critical condition.
The President of Seoul National University Hospital, Kim Yon-su,... who got the hospital's very first jab, reassures people that there is no reason to be particularly concerned.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 variant cases continue to pop up, though most are being identified in people arriving from overseas.
The country added six more variant cases on Thursday, five from abroad and one domestic infection, making a total of 162.

ALSO WATCH: Is the vaccine safe? Your questions answered https://youtu.be/QhKiopuZbtg

Both the Pfizer-BioNTech (also in use in Britain and the US) and Moderna (used in the US) vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology that involves injecting snippets of the COVID-19 genetic code, triggering an immune response without actually exposing the patient to the virus. Both vaccines are said to have an efficacy rate of about 95%. 

The China-made Sinovac vaccine uses an inactivated COVID-19 virus to trigger an immune response. There is a lack of specific results on its efficacy at the moment. As of January 7, 2020, the Sinovac vaccine has not been used in any country. 

Co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong tells #TalkingPoint why the Singapore Government convened an expert panel as early as April 2020 to look into early purchases of COVID-19 vaccines based on early-stage clinical information.

Director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH) Vernon Lee said “all the vaccines approved in Singapore are safe and efficacious”, but that some may be more suited to certain subpopulations. The Pfizer vaccine for instance - the only one in use in Singapore as of Jan 8 - is not for use in those with severe allergic reactions.

Germany, France, Spain and Italy are all taking the precautionary measure of suspending use of the vaccine because of fears about possible side-effects including blood clots. 

Use of the AstraZeneca vaccine has already been suspended in the Netherlands, Ireland, Iceland, Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway. 

The World Health Organisation along with the EU's own medicines regulator says there is no justification for the ban and most British scientists insist the vaccine is safe. 

 Italy has suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine as it faces a third wave of the pandemic, with a sharp rise in infections.  It’s government has introduced new restrictions including the closure of schools, shops and restaurants. 

Huw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by medical editor Fergus Walsh,  Europe editor Katya Adler and Rome correspondent Mark Lowen.

The country has received 1 million doses of the jab. It had planned to start using it to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers from mid-February. The study, involving around 2,000 people, found the vaccine offered "minimal protection" against mild and moderate cases of COVID-19. It has not yet been peer-reviewed.

The government will instead offer vaccines produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks. This newer strain is more infectious and currently accounts for more than 90% of the COVID-19 cases in the country. South Africa plans to vaccinate at least 67% of its population by the end of the year, or around 40 million people. It has recorded nearly 1.5 million infections and more than 46,000 deaths from the virus.

Developers of theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccinesay they will have a modified jab ready by the end of this summer. The early results for the AstraZeneca vaccine against the South African variant could have far-reaching implications in the fight against coronavirus on the continent. Many African nationshad been planning to use the AstraZeneca shot owing to its affordability and the fact that it can be kept in ordinary refrigerators. COVAX, an international procurement initiative for poorer countries, has bought the AstraZeneca vaccine in bulk from the Serum Institute of India.

That's led to a belief that some vaccines are better than others.
AstraZeneca vials are sitting unused in France and Germany, and it's reported people are cancelling their appointments in favour of getting a Pfizer shot.
Health experts say people should take whichever vaccine is available.
So who is right?

Good morning. Showers that started on Jeju and the Jeolla-do Provinces will spread to the entire country by the afternoon. Jeju's mountainous regions will see up to 200 millimeters with a heavy rain advisory in place. The rest of Jeju and the south coast will see up to 80 millimeters through tomorrow. Morning temperatures were 3 to 5 degrees higher than yesterday.

However, due to the rain, afternoon temperatures will be 5 to 6 degrees lower than yesterday hovering in the mid-teens while Jeju is under strong wind advisory as well.

The rain will continue through tomorrow morning, then sunny skies should stay with us throughout the rest of the week.

That's Korea for you and here's a look at the weather conditions around the world.

How will each vaccine hold up to the SARS-CoV-2 variants?  What does the research say about people who’ve already had COVID-19 who get a vaccine? How long will immunity last for the vaccines or COVID-19 infection?

Shane Crotty is a Professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research, Crotty Lab.  Prof. Crotty also has an academic appointment with the University of California San Diago.  See his full bio here: https://www.lji.org/labs/crotty/#over...

But there have been problems from supply to side effects.
Now, European regulators say the vaccine can, in rare cases, cause blood clots.
The UK is to offer alternative jabs to young people, who appear to be more at risk.
But both the UK and the EU say they remain confident in the Astrazeneca vaccine's effectiveness and safety.
There have been fewer than 80 cases reported in the UK despite more than 20 million doses being given out.
So, should people be worried?

Yesterday, a senior official from the European Medicines Agency said there appears to be a 'clear link' between the Oxford vaccine and rare blood clots. And, as a UK trial of the vaccine is paused - is there a real cause for concern? We're joined by Professor of Immunology, Danny Altmann and Executive Chair of the Medical Research Council, Professor Fiona Watt to discuss.

But what impact will the policy change have? And could the vaccine rollout suffer? Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

The recommendation comes after a review by the UK drugs regulator found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.

The regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clots.

But it said the link was getting firmer.

No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved by the FDA, but Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech hope to receive emergency approval based on preliminary data from their ongoing vaccine trials.  

Moderna's two-dose vaccine regimen does not require special refrigeration (the Pfizer vaccine is supposed to be stored at -70 Celcius) but a variety of questions remain:
Will the vaccine prevent transmission and asymptomatic spread?  
How long will immunity last?  
Will “94.5% effective” hold up to peer-review and additional data when it is gathered?

Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin has warned of a spiral back into sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. Saturday marked the 23rd anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the conflict known as The Troubles. But now violence is flaring again. A week of rioting has rocked the British province - and drawn in many young people.
Young unionists threw stones, iron sheets, Molotov cocktails at police on Friday night for over two hours. Law enforcement advanced only cautiously, to avoid provoking the youth. On Saturday, In pro-Union neighborhoods, many feel betrayed. Brexit has cut them off from the rest of the UK. 
Even though the country is part of the UK. Many people feel they have been cut loose from their homeland. 
Some radical groups are encouraging young people to take to the street. In many pro-union neighborhoods, young people are dealing with poverty and hopelessness and coronavirus restrictions. Violence is also an outlet for frustration.  
No one knows where the violence will lead. But it's almost certain people in Northern Ireland haven't seen the end of unrest.

South Korea has reported  587 new COVID-19 cases over the past 24 hours,... slightly below the 600 mark due to fewer tests being done over the weekend.
The nation's total caseload is now more than 100 thousand.
In a bid to contain rising infections nationwide, health authorities are imposing stricter social distancing measures in the greater Seoul area as well as in Busan for three more weeks.
Choi Won-jong starts us off.
South Korea is extending level two social distancing nationwide until May 2nd...as the country attempts to stem the spate of recent infections.
One major change... starting Monday,... is that all bars and clubs in the Seoul metropolitan area and in the southern port city of Busan have to close for the duration of the period.
Restaurants abiding by social distancing will be permitted to have customers dine in until 10 PM... but this could change to 9 PM if the virus situation worsens.
Also, under the extended measures, five or more people are not allowed to gather together.
Wearing a face mask has been mandatory outside for a while now,... but starting Monday,... people must wear them inside as well.
People violating the new rule will be fined 100-thousand Korean won, which is around 90 U.S. dollars.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in will preside over an emergency meeting on Monday afternoon... to further discuss the current COVID-19 situation as well as providing a more detailed schedule for the vaccine rollout in South Korea.
Meanwhile, health authorities are resuming the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout to more than 140-thousand people either working at special education schools or as school nurses.
This comes after South Korea temporarily put the vaccine on hold due to concerns over a potential link to blood clots.
However, people under 30 will be not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine going forward.
They will instead be given alternative vaccines like those produced by Pfizer and Moderna.

In this video, we illustrate how this vaccine works. It is an inactive viral vaccine, unlike many of the other COVID-19 vaccines out there. What is an inactivated viral vaccine and what other vaccines are similar? We describe the Phase 1, 2, and 3 Trial data out there on the CoronaVac including adverse effects, immunogenicity, and efficacy (there is some discussion to be had here!). Lastly, we cover production, distribution, and storage of the CoronaVac!

The vaccine is being widely used in the United States and has the advantage of only requiring one dose, unlike the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna alternatives which all require two doses.
The government announced it was ending negotiations with the company because it is the same type of vaccine as the AstraZeneca product which will be produced by the tens of millions in Australia.
The federal opposition is demanding further explanation about why the government made this decision.

Two Chinese journalists were sent to Wuhan to investigate a mysterious virus outbreak. This is their account of the three days before Wuhan entered lockdown. The World Health Organization held meetings to decide if the epidemic was a global health emergency. It did not consider it so. When the journalists arrive, locals were busy preparing for upcoming Chinese New Year celebration. At the time, not much was known about the virus that was just days away from changing the world. Then came a pivotal announcement: human-to-human transmission was confirmed. The journalists witnessed a city of 11 million people transform overnight. Initial nonchalance was quickly replaced by panic. People started wearing masks, shops were shuttered. They shuttled between the increasingly saturated hospitals and Huanan Seafood Market, at the time thought to be the epicentre of this contagion. And they were stopped at every juncture. Their reports were censored and their investigations blocked. @AJIUnit

Covid-19 501.V2 has been found in all of the country’s nine provinces and has led 
to several countries banning flights from South Africa. The variant has 
been associated with a higher viral load, leading some scientists to 
believe it is more transmissible and possibly a major contributing 
factor in the surge in infections around the globe. 
However the government &amp; leading scientists are blaming the current 
surge in infections to a lack of adherence to coronavirus containment 
measures and “superspreader” events during the festive period.

It's not known what is causing the disorder or where it came from, but a cluster of more than 40 cases have already been confirmed in the Atlantic province, with 5 deaths associated with it since the first case in 2015. 

Researchers investigating the mysterious neurological syndrome say a potential cause may be some kind of environmental exposure.

Dr. Alier Marrero, neurologist at Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre, gives us more details on what we know about the mysterious disease.

A little more than a thousand registered cases and only 11 COVID related deaths for a population of nearly 24 million. Strict quarantine controls and test and trace are being attributed to the island's remarkable success in keeping case numbers low. Something that was visible when a small outbreak hit a large hospital back in January. 
As many countries around the world battle second, even third waves of the coronavirus, life in Taiwan appears near normal.

In response, the South Korean foreign ministry summoned Japan's top envoy to Seoul. South Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-moon met with Japanese Ambassador Koichi Aiboshi, according to officials. Choi was expected to express regrets and lodge a protest during the meeting.

Several other EU countries have stopped use of the vaccine because of the possibility of blood clots. The Health Ministry announced that use of the vaccine was "suspended as a precaution" on the basis of advice from the national health regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). According to the Health Ministry, the European Medicines Agency will decide "whether and how the new information will affect the authorization of the vaccine" pending an investigation.

In addition to Germany, nations across Europe and worldwide have halted use of the vaccine because of possible clotting risks. Italy and France both issued similar statements on Monday afternoon, soon after Germany. Last week, Denmark became the first country to suspend implementation, with Norway, Iceland and Bulgaria following. Non-European nations to have suspend use of the vaccine include Thailand and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Poorer countries have neither. It could be years before some are fully-vaccinated. Recent setbacks with AstraZeneca and Johnson&amp;Johnson, the most accessible vaccines, aren't helping. 
And that's raising questions about when widespread vaccination coverage will be achieved? By the end of the year in high-income countries. Middle-income nations will have to wait another year. Poorer places aren’t expected to be vaccinated before 2023. If at all. A key factor holding back the vaccination drive is patents.

South Korea's daily COVID-19 tally stood at 7-hundred-31 on Wednesday.
Health authorities are better prepared for the next wave with enough hospital beds and medical resources, but still warn of complacency... citing a 15-percent increase in recent weekend travels.
Jang Tae-hyun brings the updates.
COVID-19 cases are popping up across South Korea,... and it appears the country is on the edge of a fourth wave.
As of Wednesday, there are one-hundred severely ill coronavirus patients,... but health authorities say that the country has enough facilities to treat them all.

"We have the capacity to take care of one-thousand patients as well as 13-hundred who are critically ill. But, we will try to secure more hospital beds at treatment facilities and dedicated hospitals in case the situation worsens and we start to see two-thousand daily cases."

Health authorities will take a close look at this week's caseload before announcing any possible changes to the distancing measures.
It was announced last Friday that the current measures will be extended for three weeks, adding that restaurants and cafes in the capital region can open until 10 PM, but this could change to 9 PM.
More than 70 percent of cases are also coming from the heavily-populated capital region.
On top of that, of about 81-hundred newly-infected people over the past two weeks,... the route of infection of 28 percent of them is unknown.
South Korea's health authorities say the distancing level could be tightened further, but they are concerned about the economic damage that would cause.
The country recorded 731 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday.
Of them, 714 were locally transmitted and the rest from overseas.
As of Wednesday, more than one-point-two million people in South Korea have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Time now for an in-depth look at the market news this afternoon.
And for that, I'm joined on the line by Dr. Kim Sei-wan, Professor of Economics at Ewha Womans University.
Professor Kim, thank you for making time today.

Thank you.

The IMF earlier this month revised its outlook for global economic growth this year... upwards to 6 percent. And for Korea, it's been raised to 3-point-6 percent. If that holds true, it sounds like good news. What do you make of these forecasts, professor?

The IMF and others are also warning that Korea could face a debt explosion... because of its aging population and the long-term liabilities that implies. The IMF is projecting a big rise in the country's debt from 2026. Tell us what prompted this warning and what can be done about the situation.

Stocks on Wall Street were mixed overnight as corporate earnings started coming in. The Dow up a little, but the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq off by somewhat more than that. What's the story in the global markets?

Korean stocks did alright today, though. The KOSDAQ is holding onto the gains from its recent rally above 1-thousand points. It's at its highest in 20 years. The KOSPI with a moderate gain today. Tell us about the local markets.

A report from the automobile industry finds that Korean carmakers are only two-percent self-sufficient when it comes to the semiconductors they need for their products. That is around 98 percent of them are imported, despite Korea being one of the world's biggest producers of computer chips in general. What do you make of that data, professor?

Most of the deceased were reportedly elderly and terminally ill patients.
Following the post-mortem of the deceased, as many as 13 reports suggested common side-effects of the vaccine in the sick patients, said the Norwegian government.
More than 30,000 people have received the first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna coronavirus vaccine in the Scandinavian country since the end of December, according to official figures. Reacting to the deaths, the vaccine maker, Pfizer, has said that "the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations."

South Korea is moving to address possible delays in the delivery of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
Authorities reaffirmed that rollout will continue as planned... partly thanks to more doses being produced in Korea starting this summer.
Lee Kyung-eun brings the updates.
Despite a global vaccine shortage,... the South Korean government says that the country's vaccination drive will go on as planned,…without delay.
The nation's vaccine supply task force reaffirmed its stance on Thursday,... saying,...starting August,... more vaccines will be produced IN COUNTRY.
It wasn't specified which vaccine that would be as the deal has not been finalized.
But a vaccine task force official says that the locally-produced vaccines will help stabilize domestic supply.
Currently, SK Bioscience is contracted to produce vaccines by AstraZeneca and Novavax in South Korea.
And, despite concerns of a potential delay due to the suspension of Johnson and Johnson's Janssen vaccine in the U.S.,...authorities remain positive.

"Despite the suspension of Janssen vaccine in the United States, our rollout plan remains unchanged for now. We, along with the KDCA, will continue to monitor the situation and review the safety of the vaccines."

The U.S. FDA on Tuesday recommended a pause of the vaccine,... after "rare and severe" blood clots were reported in six cases from the total of six-point-eight million people inoculated.
While the investigation continues,...the vaccine remains suspended.
A federal vaccine advisory committee on Wednesday said it does not have enough evidence to determine whether the vaccine should be continued, discontinued... or recommended only for certain age groups.
While the rollouts of Janssen vaccines have also been delayed in Europe,.. an Italian media outlet has reported that the EU has decided not to renew COVID-19 vaccine contracts with J&amp;J for next year.
But, the reports are yet to be officially confirmed by the EU.

We start with the coronavirus situation in South Korea.
The country on Thursday saw just under 700 new cases of COVID-19.
As daily infections are trending up, health authorities are stepping up inspections of high-risk locations, such as cafes and daycare centers.
Jang Tae-hyun reports.
South Korea reported 698 cases on Thursday, 670 of them local and the rest from overseas.
Over 60 percent of the cases are from the capital region.
The number is slightly lower than the previous day, but the general trend is an increase in cases.
Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters official Jeon Hae-cheol said on Thursday that a month ago, one-point-one-one percent of tests for COVID-19 came back positive, but this rate has increased to one-point-six-two percent in the past week.
The rate has been increasing for four weeks straight.
To stop the spread, health authorities are increasing their checks for prevention guideline violations.
The official said that after the implementation of stricter checks starting April 5th,... the number of violations went up from 30 to 150 cases per week.
Starting from Thursday, central and local government workers will cooperate to inspect nine types of vulnerable spots like cafes, bathhouses and daycare centers.
And health authorities will try to speed up the vaccination rollout for 350-thousand medical center and pharmacy workers,... which had been originally planned for late April.
As of Thursday, a total of more than one-point-two-eight million people have received the first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine.

The Bank of Korea has brightened its outlook for the country's economy this year,... suggesting that the recovery will be stronger and faster than previously forecast.
But with uncertainty still so high, the BOK is keeping its benchmark interest rate where it's been since last May at half a percent.
Kim Sung-min has the details.
South Korea's central bank said on Thursday that the country's economy in 2021 will expand faster than its previous forecast of 3-percent GDP growth.

"Growth around the mid-3-percent mark is easily possible considering the current recovery trend of the global and domestic economy. There has been a large scale stimulus package in the U.S. followed by a global economic rebound,... and domestic exports as well as facility investment are also expanding faster than previously expected."

Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol added that the improvement in private consumption followed by eased social distancing restrictions is another sign of the recovery of the domestic economy.
The projection comes as the country is seeing an increase in new COVID-19 cases the daily tally reaching around 700 while the vaccine rollout is making slow progress.
Behind the confident forecast is the assumption that the nation's COVID-19 situation will not get significantly worse than the current level.
But given that there is still much uncertainty, the central bank on Thursday once again froze its benchmark interest rate at a record low of point-five percent for the seventh straight time.
The bank aims to continue with its expansionary policy until the current economic recovery takes root, while keeping a close look at how the COVID-19 situation unfolds.
Last year, the country's central bank cut its key interest rate twice to point-seven-five percent in March and once more to a record-low point-five percent just two months later in May.

South Korea's central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of point-five percent.
The decision was made during a policy meeting on Thursday, with the bank maintaining its expansionary policy due to the economic uncertainties amid the pandemic.
Although the country's exports and investment are showing signs of recovery, domestic consumption has been sluggish as the number of infections soars.
The Bank of Korea cut its key interest rate to point-seven-five percent in March 2020 and lowered it once more last May to point-five percent.

The American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has made its debut on the Nasdaq, in what some are calling a watershed moment for the crypto sector... that could take it mainstream.
The same day, though, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described cryptocurrencies as “vehicles for speculation."
Our Seo Eunkyung reports.
Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, went public on Wednesday, U.S. Eastern time, on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
It went public through a direct listing, which does not involve issuing new shares, and opened at 381 U.S. dollars per share, over 50 percent higher than its reference price of 250 dollars set by Nasdaq as a benchmark.
The stock closed at 328 dollars, but before that, it soared to a high of 429-point-54 dollars, making Coinbase Global's valuation hit 112 billion dollars.
Market watchers view Coinbase's debut on the public market as a breakthrough for digital currencies to be accepted by mainstream finance.

"What it represents is a validation of this nascent market sector.
It really confirms that this industry sector is here to stay, but it also concretely demonstrates consumer-level confidence in crypto-currencies."

However, on the same day that Coinbase went public, Jerome Powell defined cryptocurrencies as speculative assets.
He also said, in an interview with the Economic Club of New York, that digital assets are not "being actively used as payments".
Bitcoin hit a record high of nearly 65-thousand dollars ahead of Coinbase going public, but the figure dropped to around 62-thousand dollars after Powell's remarks.
On Thursday, South Korea's central bank governor Lee Ju-yeol also said many difficulties exist when it comes to using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.

It got the Linking Cities award for its use of robots... in the homes of senior citizens... to help them catch up with the kinds of technology now ubiquitous in our daily lives.
For instance, the robots help seniors use the messenger app KakaoTalk.
And it helps them book train tickets and use digital kiosks at restaurants.
The award will be presented on April 15, Paris time, at the 'UNESCO Netexplo Linking Cities Forum.'

The blood clots that Lauren survived are considered “very rare” by The European Medicines Agency. The EMA has maintained that the benefits of using AstraZeneca‘s vaccine continue outweigh any risks, as has Health Canada.

Yet for Lauren, it all started 10 days after getting the vaccine, when she woke up breathless, with high fever and a “horrendous headache,” which then led her to believe she might have contracted the coronavirus. However, upon getting tested, her reports came up negative, although her symptoms persisted.

Lauren speaks with Global’s Dawna Friesen about her situation.

Tesla's CEO Elon Musk says that could soon become a reality particularly for people with paralysis.

His brain-chip startup Neuralink has just enabled a monkey to play a videogame by thinking.

They did it by embedding two chips on each side of the animal's brain to record his mind activity.

As part of the experiment the macaque was trained to move a joystick.

Data sent to the computer was then used to allow the monkey to control the stick just by thinking about moving its hand up or down.

So, what could be the downsides?

We discuss these news headlines and then dive into the study they are referring to to determine whether these claims really are true or if they are exaggerated.

Gao Fu said his country is considering options to boost the effectiveness of doses including mixing different brands.
That's as major side effects from other Covid-19 vaccines have slowed down vaccination drives elsewhere.
The U.S. has recommended 'pausing' the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine following reports of blood clots.
AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine is being investigated by European regulators for similar cases..
And a new Israeli study has found the coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa can penetrate Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine to some extent.

So, do the coronavirus vaccines benefits still outweigh the risks?
